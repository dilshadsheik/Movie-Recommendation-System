# 🎥 Movie Recommender System

A machine learning-based recommendation system that predicts user preferences for movies using collaborative filtering. Built with the `Surprise` library, this system analyzes user ratings and provides personalized recommendations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict user ratings.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Supports RMSE and MAE for performance evaluation.
- **Custom Predictions**: Allows predicting ratings for specific user-movie pairs.
- **Cross-Validation**: Includes a robust k-fold cross-validation mechanism.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
- **Files Used**:
  - `movies.csv`: Contains movie metadata (e.g., titles, genres).
  - `ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings for movies.

---

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Load the dataset:
   ```python
   from surprise import Dataset, Reader
   data = Dataset.load_from_df(ratings[['userId', 'movieId', 'rating']], Reader(rating_scale=(0.5, 5.0)))
   ```

2. Train the SVD model:
   ```python
   from surprise import SVD
   from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split

   trainset, testset = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2)
   svd = SVD()
   svd.fit(trainset)
   ```

3. Predict a rating for a user-movie pair:
   ```python
   prediction = svd.predict(uid=1, iid=1)
   print(prediction)
   ```

4. Evaluate the model:
   ```python
   from surprise import accuracy
   predictions = svd.test(testset)
   accuracy.rmse(predictions)
   ```

## 📈 Results

- **RMSE**: Achieved a root mean square error of `X.XXX`.
- **MAE**: Mean absolute error of `Y.YYY`.
